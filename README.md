# Edge EA Pro MT5

Edge EA Pro MT5 is a fully automated trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It utilizes advanced techniques, including neural networks and technical analysis, to generate accurate trading signals and execute trades in the MetaTrader 5 platform.

## How It Works

The EA is built using the MQL5 programming language and makes use of various libraries and classes to perform its functions. Here is a brief overview of how the code works:

1. Include necessary libraries and classes: The EA includes several libraries and classes to access trading functions, technical indicators, price data, wave analysis, market patterns, Fibonacci areas, neural networks, and risk management mechanisms.

2. OnTick Event: This event is triggered on each tick of the price data. It processes inputs, such as current price and technical indicator values, performs wave analysis, identifies market patterns using Fibonacci areas, processes inputs through hidden layers of the neural network, refines the output signal, and executes trades based on predicted price movements. It also applies risk management mechanisms to manage the trading risk.

3. RefineSignal Function: This function is responsible for refining the output signal to improve prediction accuracy. You can add your own code in this function to further refine the signal as per your requirements.

4. OnDeinit Event: This event is triggered when the EA is deactivated or removed from the chart. You can add your own code in this event to clean up resources and perform any necessary tasks before the EA is stopped.

5. OnInit Event: This event is triggered when the EA is initialized. You can add your own code in this event to initialize any necessary resources and settings before the EA starts trading.

6. OnStart Event: This event is triggered when the EA starts trading. You can add your own code in this event to start the execution of the trading robot as per your trading strategy.

7. OnError Function: This function is responsible for handling any errors that may occur during the execution of the EA. You can add your own code in this function to handle errors in a customized way.
